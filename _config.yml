  I have a background in Geodesy and Geoinformatics and am obtaining a PhD in Geomatics from The University of Melbourne. In my research, I specialise in Spatial Data Quality and Topological relations.  My reserach has been published in renowned journals in the fields of GIScience, Spatial Databases, Positioning, Urbanism, and Smart Cities. I have expertise in Spatial Databases and Programming in GIS, and work experience in QGIS plugin development, Linux server administration, teaching, marketing data analysis, and land surveying.
